  <para>
   In case a user does not have commit permissions to a project, they can request
   maintainership permissions to this project. This makes sense if the
   user is already known to the project owners and they trust them as a
   maintainer. There is a way to do this via the request system of OBS, but
   only via osc so far:
<screen><command># osc createrequest -a add_me maintainer PROJECT</command></screen>

  <title>Contributing to Foreign Projects Indirectly</title>
  <para>
   Users who are new to a certain project, either because they are new users at
   all or do not have any deeper knowledge about this certain project don't have
   direct commit permissions. However, they can still create a copy of any
   package source and ask back to merge their changes. Open Build Service has support to
   make this easy.
