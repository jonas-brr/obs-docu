 <title>Cross Architecture Build</title>
 <info/>
 <para> OBS can build for architectures without having the hardware. This is
  done via emulation steps. However, this is not a classic build with cross
  tool chains. The advantage is that the build environments of the packages do
  not need support for cross tools. </para>
