 <title>Building Preinstall Images</title>
 <info/>
 <para> Preinstall images can optionally be used to install a set of packages
  in one quick step instead via single package installations. Depending on the
  build host even snapshots with copy-on-write support may be used which avoids
  any IO. </para>
 <para> A preinstall image can be used if it provides a subset of packages
  which is required for the build job. The largest possible image is taken if
  multiple are usable. </para>
 <para> To use a preinstall image there needs to be a package container inside
  of the project or in a repository used by the build job. This package needs a
  _preinstallimage file. The syntax of it is spec file like, but just needs a
  Name: and at least one BuildRequires: line.
 </para>
 <para>
  To ignore packages despite existing dependencies, use
  <literal>#!BuildIgnore:</literal> tags or <literal>%if</literal>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Preinstall image build jobs are always preferred to allow the best
  effect of them. We recommend defining images for often used standard
  stacks. </para>
 <para> Example _preinstallimage file for a basic preinstall image: </para>
  <screen>Name: base
BuildRequires: bash
#!BuildIgnore: brp-trim-desktopfiles</screen>
