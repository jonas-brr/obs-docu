  <title>Interconnect</title>
  <para>Using another Open Build Service as source for build targets is the
   easiest way to start. The advantage is, that you save local resources and
   you do not need to build everything from scratch. The disadvantage is that
   you depend on the remote instance, if it has a downtime your instance cannot
   do any builds for these targets, if the remote admins decide to remove some
   targets you cannot use them anymore.</para>
  <para>The easiest way to interconnect with some of the public OBS
   instances is to use the Web UI. You need to log in with an administrator
   account of your instance to do this. On the start page of an administrator
   account you will find a <emphasis role="strong">Configuration</emphasis>
   link. On the Configuration page you find an Interconnect tab on the top, use
   this and select the public side you want.</para>
  <para>If you want to connect to a not listed instance, you can simple
   create a remote project using the <emphasis>osc meta prj</emphasis> command.
   A remote project differs from a local project as it has a <emphasis
    role="strong">remoteurl</emphasis> tag (see <xref
    linkend="meta-data-project-meta-data"/>).</para>
  <para>Example:</para>
  <screen>&lt;project name="openSUSE.org"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;openSUSE.org Project Link&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
This project refers to projects hosted on the &osbs;
&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;remoteurl&gt;https://api.opensuse.org/public&lt;/remoteurl&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</screen>
  <para>Sending this via osc to the server:</para>
  <screen>osc meta prj -m "add openSUSE.org remote" -F /tmp/openSUSE.org.prj</screen>
