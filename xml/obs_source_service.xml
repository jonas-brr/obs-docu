  <title>About Source Service</title>
  <para>
   Source Services are tools to validate, generate or modify sources in a
   trustable way. They are designed as smallest possible tools and can be
   combined following the powerful idea of the classic UNIX design.
  </para>
  <para>
   Source services allow:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Server side generated files are easy to identify and are not
     modifiable by the user. This way other user can trust them to be
     generated in the documented way without modifications.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Generated files never create merge conflicts.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Generated files are a separate commit to the user change.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Services are runnable at any time without user commit.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Services are runnable on server and client side in the same way.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Services are safe. A source checkout and service run never harms
     the system of a user.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Services avoid unnecessary commits.
     This means there are no time-dependent changes. In case the package
     already contains the same file, the newly generated file are dropped.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Services running local or inside the build environment can get created,
     added and used by everybody.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Services running in default or server side mode must be installed by
     the administrator of the &obsa; server.

     The use of a service can be defined per package or project wide.

    <term>Default Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The default mode of a service is to always run after each commit on
      the server side and locally before every local build.

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>trylocal</literal> Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode is running the service locally. The result is committed
      as standard files and not named with a <literal>_service:</literal>
      prefix. Additionally, the service runs on the server by
      default. Usually the service should detect that the result is the same
      and skip the generated files. In case they differ, they are generated
      and added on the server.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>localonly</literal> Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode is running the service locally. The result gets committed
      as standard files and not named  with <literal>_service:</literal> prefix.
      The service is never running on the server side. It is also not
      possible to trigger it manually.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>serveronly</literal> Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The serveronly mode is running the service on the server only. This
      can be useful, when the service is not available or can not work on
      developer workstations.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>buildtime</literal> Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The service is running inside of the build job, both for local and
      server side builds. A side effect is that the service package is
      becoming a build dependency and must be available. Every user can
      provide and use a service this way in their projects. The generated
      sources are not part of the source repository, but part of the
      generated source packages.
      Note that services requiring external network access are likely to
      fail in this mode, because such access is not available if the build
      workers are running in secure mode<phrase
       os="opensuse;novell"> (as is always the case at <link
        xlink:href="https://build.opensuse.org"/>)</phrase>.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>manual</literal> Mode</term>
    <term><literal>disabled</literal> Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The manual mode is neither running the service locally nor on the
      server side by default. It can be used to temporarily disable the service but keeping
      the definition as part of the service definition. Or it can be used to
      define the way how to generate the sources and doing so by manually calling
      <command>osc service rundisabled</command>.
      The result will get committed as standard files again.
      NOTE: it did only exist as "disabled" before OBS 2.11, but "manual" is the better
            matching alias name for its usage. The osc client may do have different
            behaviour in future between manual and disabled.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-obs-sserv-validate">
  <title>Defining Services for Validation</title>
  <para>
   Source Services can be used to validate sources. This can be defined
   at different levels:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <formalpara>
     <title>Per Package</title>
     <para>
      Useful when the packager wants to validate whether the downloaded
      sources are really from the original maintainer.
     </para>
    </formalpara>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <formalpara>
     <title>Per Project</title>
     <para>
      Useful for applying project-wide policies which cannot be skipped for
      any package.
     </para>
    </formalpara>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   You can validate sources using either of two methods:
  </para>
  <remark>toms 2017-09-01: by sknorr FIXME: regarding the list:
  however, (based off my interpretation) the use cases seem to be different
  for those two methods: the first guards against corruptions that happen
  on the way between maintainer and you (i.e. rogue ISP). the second guards
  against corruptions between the source project and you (i.e. rogue
  maintainer). Interestingly, neither guards against both.
  </remark>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     By comparing checksums and metadata of the files in your repository
     with checksums and metadata as recorded by the maintainer.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>

     Alternatively, you can download the sources from a trusted location
     again and verify that they did not change.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-obs-sserv-create">
  <title>Creating Source Service Definitions</title>
  <para>
   Source services are defined in the <filename>_service</filename> file
   and are either part of the package sources or used project-wide.
   Project-wide services are stored under the <uri>_project</uri> package
   in file <filename>_service</filename>.
  </para>
  <para> The <filename>_service</filename> file contains a list of services
   which get called in the listed order. Each service can define a list of
   parameters and a mode.
   The project wide services get called after the per package defined
   services.
   </para>
  <para>
   The <filename>_service</filename> file is in XML format and looks like this:

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-obs-sserv-remove">
  <title>Removing a Source Service</title>
  <para> Sometimes it is useful to continue working on generated files
   manually. In this situation the <filename>_service</filename> file needs
   to be dropped, but all
   generated files need to be committed as standard files. The &obsa;
   provides the <command>mergeservice</command> command for this. It can
   also be used via &osccmd; by calling
    <command>osc service merge</command>. </para>

  <title>Trigger a service run via a webhook</title>
  <para>You may want to update sources in &obs; whenever they change in a SCM
        system. You can create a token which allows to trigger a specific
        package update and use it via a webhook. It is recommended to create
        a token for a specific package and not a wildcard token.
